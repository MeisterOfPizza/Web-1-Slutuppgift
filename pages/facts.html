                                <p>Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977.
                                    Part of
                                    the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System, Voyager 1 was launched 16 days
                                    after
                                    its twin, Voyager 2. Having operated for 41 years, 4 months and 12 days as of
                                    January
                                    17,
                                    2019, the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive
                                    routine
                                    commands and to transmit data to Earth. At a distance of 145.11 astronomical units
                                    (2.1708×1010 km; 1.3489×1010 mi) (21.708 billion kilometers; 13.489 billion miles)
                                    from
                                    Earth as of January 1, 2019,[3] it is the most distant human-made object from
                                    Earth.[4]

                                    The probe's objectives included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest
                                    moon,
                                    Titan. While the spacecraft's course could have been altered to include a Pluto
                                    encounter
                                    by forgoing the Titan flyby, exploration of the moon, which was known to have a
                                    substantial
                                    atmosphere, took priority.[5][6][7] Voyager 1 studied the weather, magnetic fields,
                                    and
                                    rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of
                                    their
                                    moons.

                                    After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 12, 1980,
                                    Voyager
                                    1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity, which
                                    will
                                    allow them to leave the Solar System. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 became the
                                    first
                                    spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium.[8]

                                    In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1, the Voyager team completed a
                                    successful test of the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters
                                    in
                                    late
                                    2017 (the first time these thrusters were fired since 1980), a project enabling the
                                    mission
                                    to be extended by two to three years.[9]

                                    Voyager 1's extended mission is expected to continue until about 2025, when its
                                    radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough electric power
                                    to
                                    operate its scientific instruments.</p>

                                    Earth.[4]

                                    The probe's objectives included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest
                                    moon,
                                    Titan. While the spacecraft's course could have been altered to include a Pluto
                                    encounter
                                    by forgoing the Titan flyby, exploration of the moon, which was known to have a
                                    substantial
                                    atmosphere, took priority.[5][6][7] Voyager 1 studied the weather, magnetic fields,
                                    and
                                    rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of
                                    their
                                    moons.

                                    After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 12, 1980,
                                    Voyager
                                    1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity, which
                                    will
                                    allow them to leave the Solar System. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 became the
                                    first
                                    spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium.[8]

                                    In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1, the Voyager team completed a
                                    successful test of the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters
                                    in
                                    late
                                    2017 (the first time these thrusters were fired since 1980), a project enabling the
                                    mission
                                    to be extended by two to three years.[9]

                                    Voyager 1's extended mission is expected to continue until about 2025, when its
                                    radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough electric power
                                    to
                                    operate its scientific instruments.</p>

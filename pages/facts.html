                                Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977.
                                Part of
                                the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System, Voyager 1 was launched 16 days
                                after
                                its twin, Voyager 2. Having operated for 41 years, 4 months and 12 days as of
                                January
                                17,
                                2019, the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive
                                routine
                                commands and to transmit data to Earth. At a distance of 145.11 astronomical units
                                (2.1708×1010 km; 1.3489×1010 mi) (21.708 billion kilometers; 13.489 billion miles)
                                from
                                Earth as of January 1, 2019,[3] it is the most distant human-made object from
                                Earth.[4]

                                The probe's objectives included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest
                                moon,
                                Titan. While the spacecraft's course could have been altered to include a Pluto
                                encounter
                                by forgoing the Titan flyby, exploration of the moon, which was known to have a
                                substantial
                                atmosphere, took priority.[5][6][7] Voyager 1 studied the weather, magnetic fields,
                                and
                                rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of
                                their
                                moons.

                                After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 12, 1980,
                                Voyager
                                1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity, which
                                will
                                allow them to leave the Solar System. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 became the
                                first
                                spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium.[8]

                                In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1, the Voyager team completed a
                                successful test of the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters
                                in
                                late
                                2017 (the first time these thrusters were fired since 1980), a project enabling the
                                mission
                                to be extended by two to three years.[9]

                                Voyager 1's extended mission is expected to continue until about 2025, when its
                                radioisotope thermoelectric generators will no longer supply enough electric power
                                to
                                operate its scientific instruments.

                                Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977.
                                Part of
                                the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System, Voyager 1 was launched 16 days
                                after
                                its twin, Voyager 2. Having operated for 41 years, 4 months and 12 days as of
                                January
                                17,
                                2019, the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive
                                routine
                                commands and to transmit data to Earth. At a distance of 145.11 astronomical units
                                (2.1708×1010 km; 1.3489×1010 mi) (21.708 billion kilometers; 13.489 billion miles)
                                from
                                Earth as of January 1, 2019,[3] it is the most distant human-made object from
                                Earth.[4]

                                The probe's objectives included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest
                                moon,
                                Titan. While the spacecraft's course could have been altered to include a Pluto
                                encounter
                                by forgoing the Titan flyby, exploration of the moon, which was known to have a
                                substantial
                                atmosphere, took priority.[5][6][7] Voyager 1 studied the weather, magnetic fields,
                                and
                                rings of the two planets and was the first probe to provide detailed images of
                                their
                                moons.

                                After completing its primary mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 12, 1980,
                                Voyager
                                1 became the third of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity, which
                                will
                                allow them to leave the Solar System. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 became the
                                first
                                spacecraft to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium.[8]

                                In a further testament to the robustness of Voyager 1, the Voyager team completed a
                                successful test of the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters
                                in
                                late
                                2017 (the first time these thrusters were fired since 1980), a project enabling the
                                mission
                                to be extended by two to three years.[9]
